            <h2>Web Developer & Designer</h2>
            <p>     I have a passion for both technology and fitness, I like to balance studying with an active lifestyle that includes running,
                climbing, and cycling. When I am not coding and trouble shooting programmes, I can be found running through trails, 
                scaling climbing walls, or cycling long distances. Being dedicated to fitness not only keeps me physically strong but also
                helps me stay focused and disciplined in my academic journey.
            </p>
            
            <p>     I am eager to develop my coding skills and explore new technologies. My ability to
                tackle physical challenges with determination and persistence mirrors my approach to problem-solving and 
                continuous improvement.
