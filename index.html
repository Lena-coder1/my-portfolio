        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, my name is Lena I am an active and determined individual who is currently in my first year of computer programming. 
            With a passion for both technology and fitness, I like to balance studying with an active lifestyle that includes running,
            climbing, and cycling. When I am not coding and solving programming challenges, I can be found running through trails, 
            scaling climbing walls, or cycling long distances. Being dedicated to fitness not only keeps me physically strong but also
            helps me stay focused and disciplined in my academic journey.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            As a first-year programming student, I am eager to develop my coding skills and explore new technologies. My ability to
            tackle physical challenges with determination and persistence mirrors my approach to problem-solving and 
            continuous improvement.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            By combining my love for sports and programming, I am on a journey to push both mental 
            and physical limits, striving for success in both the digital and real world. </p>
